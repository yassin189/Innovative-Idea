## Application Overview

A web application to help graduation teams find new, not repeated and innovative graduation project ideas by allowing companies, oraganizations, professors and other academic students from the same field or other fields to post the ideas they wish to make it live then fetching the precentage of simlarity between the previous added ideas. If the idea has a similarity of 40% or less with other projects added before then the project will be added without any problems, else if the similarity is more than 40% then the system will warns and shows you the other project ideas similar to yours and will let you choose whether to proceed adding the idea or contacting the authors of the similar projects for future collaboration and enhancements on that project.

## Technologies Used

## Future enhancements and work

Integrating a semantic search algorithm to make the system's decision about the similarity between project ideas more accurate, intelligent and reliable rather than using similar_text() function which 
returns the precentage of similarity between two strings.
